## [Batch](/Batch)

Just messing around and trying to refresh on how batch scripts worked. Also made a joke script that writes a java class and runs it.

### Best IDE

A joke project I used to make a YouTube video in which I used CMD as an "IDE".

## [Brainfuck](/Brainfuck)

This is just a compiler for [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck), written in C. It's basically a finished project at this point, and won't be updated any further. For more information, view the [Brainfuck README](/Brainfuck/README.md).

## [C](/C)

[README](/C/README.md)

### Chess

Game of chess, written in C.

### Linked Lists

A basic program that tracks a linked list. The user can add and remove names from the list, and print the list out to see all names stored.

### Massive Text File

C program with the sole purpose of making text files that are multiple gigabytes in size.

### Random Value Counter

Generates and then counts the occurrences of random numbers. 

### Small C TicTacToe

TicTacToe in C, written in as small a file I could manage. There's probably a lot of flaws in the code, but that wasn't the original focus of this project.

### C TicTacToe

TicTacToe in C. Pretty self-explanatory.

### C Wallis Formula

The [Wallis Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallis_product) is a mathematical formula used to estimate pi. This program just asks the user to enter the number of terms they want to use to estimate the value of pi. More terms will result in a more precise estimation.

## [Java](/Java)

Most of these projects were made in Java 8, if the version differs, I'll say so.

### Java Poker

Making a 5 draw poker swing application in Java.

### [Java Conway](/Java/Conway)

Conway's Game of Life Swing Application. I made an entire readme for that project alone. View it [here](/Java/Conway/README.md).

### Java Hello World

Hello World in Java. On top of being a Hello World program, I also used it to learn how to make an executable `.jar` program.

### Java Lambda Stuff

Quick and short program to learn about Lambdas in Java.

### Java Object Serialization

A small program I made so I can reference later when I forget how to serialize objects and send them to a file in Java.

### Java TicTacToe

TicTacToe game written in Java. This has a computer opponent, which will try to play as aggressive as possible.

## [Python](/Python)

Just some python, nothing much past that.

### Python Hello

Hello World in Python.

### Python Ice Cream Kiosk

Program made when helping a friend with code.

### Python Neural Networks

The beginnings of trying to learn how to create neural networks. I don't think I got too far with this, but might revisit in the future.

### Python OpenCV

Playing around with the OpenCV library.

### Python Primes

Program that generates only prime numbers.

### Python Square Root Algorithm

Simple sqaure root algorithm. Made when trying to help a friend with code.

### Python Wallis Formula

[Wallis Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallis_product) done in Python.

### Python Wichmann Hill RNG

[Wichmann Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wichmann%E2%80%93Hill) RNG done in Python.
