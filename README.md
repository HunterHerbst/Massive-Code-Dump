## Brainfuck

This is just a compiler for [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck), written in C. It's basically a finished project at this point, and won't be updated any further. For more information, view the [Brainfuck README](/Brainfuck/README.md).

## C

### Linked Lists

A basic program that tracks a linked list. The user can add and remove names from the list, and print the list out to see all names stored.

### Small C TicTacToe

TicTacToe in C, written in as small a file I could manage. There's probably a lot of flaws in the code, but that wasn't the original focus of this project.

### C TicTacToe

TicTacToe in C. Pretty self-explanatory.

## C++

C++ code will go here in the future when I eventually start using it.

## Java

Most of these projects were made in Java 8, if the version differs, I'll say so.

### Java Hello World

Hello World in Java. On top of being a Hello World program, I also used it to learn how to make an executable `.jar` program.

### Java TicTacToe

TicTacToe game written in Java. This has a computer opponent, which will try to play as aggressive as possible.

## LaTeX

I've got some tests of the LaTeX language here. I might learn more in the future, but right now I'm working on other projects.

## Python

Just some python, nothing much past that.

### Python Hello

Hello World in Python.

### Python Neural Networks

The beginnings of trying to learn how to create neural networks. I don't think I got too far with this, but might revisit in the future.

### Python OpenCV

Playing around with the OpenCV library.

### Python Primes

Program that generates only prime numbers.
