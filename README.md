## [Batch](/Batch)

Just messing around and trying to refresh on how batch scripts worked. Also made a joke script that writes a java class and runs it.

### Best IDE

A joke project I used to make a YouTube video in which I used CMD as an "IDE".

## [Brainfuck](/Brainfuck)

This is just a compiler for [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck), written in C. It's basically a finished project at this point, and won't be updated any further. For more information, view the [Brainfuck README](/Brainfuck/README.md).

## [C](</C Programming>)

### Linked Lists

A basic program that tracks a linked list. The user can add and remove names from the list, and print the list out to see all names stored.

### Small C TicTacToe

TicTacToe in C, written in as small a file I could manage. There's probably a lot of flaws in the code, but that wasn't the original focus of this project.

### C TicTacToe

TicTacToe in C. Pretty self-explanatory.

### Wallis Formula

The [Wallis Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallis_product) is a mathematical formula used to estimate pi. This program just asks the user to enter the number of terms they want to use to estimate the value of pi. More terms will result in a more precise estimation.

## C++

### Color Manipulation

Simple program that plays around with using structs in C++

## [Java](/Java)

Most of these projects were made in Java 8, if the version differs, I'll say so.

### [Java Conway](/Java/Conway)

Conway's Game of Life Swing Application. I made an entire readme for that project alone. View it [here](/Java/Conway/README.md).

### Java Hello World

Hello World in Java. On top of being a Hello World program, I also used it to learn how to make an executable `.jar` program.

### Java TicTacToe

TicTacToe game written in Java. This has a computer opponent, which will try to play as aggressive as possible.

## [LaTeX](/LaTeX)

I've got some tests of the LaTeX language here. I might learn more in the future, but right now I'm working on other projects.

## [Python](/Python)

Just some python, nothing much past that.

### Python Hello

Hello World in Python.

### Python Neural Networks

The beginnings of trying to learn how to create neural networks. I don't think I got too far with this, but might revisit in the future.

### Python OpenCV

Playing around with the OpenCV library.

### Python Primes

Program that generates only prime numbers.
